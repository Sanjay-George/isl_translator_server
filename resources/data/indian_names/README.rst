Introduction
============

This directory contains a parallel corpus of Indian names. Indian
names are presented in their Indic representation, as well as their
traditionally used Roman spelling. You can use this corpus to obtain
CMUDICT pronunciations for Indian name spellings.

File Format
===========

Anything after the # character is ignored to be a comment. Blank or
whitespace-only lines are ignored.

Every row contains two columns, separated by the TAB character.
<roman_spelling>    <indic_spelling>
